# Week 11: Small Project 2 - Create your own Repository 
This is a GitHub repository containing information reguarding my very own repository. 

# Objectives
The objectives of this project are to ensure that I can create a repository, this may prove to be a non-standard way of creating a repo considering the course I am taking is based mainly on Digital Preservation. 

GitHub allows for Programmers to create Repositories to push Code to when new changes are made to source code within a project.

For this project in particular I will be creating 5 items to place into this repository that I will submit with metadata to allow for someone to easily locate these files/items.
